## AI Prompt Instructions

ResumeAI's AI prompt logic is in the `ResumeProcessor` class in `app.py`.  
Future version will have this within the UI, if you are still keen to change it atm then edit the following methods to change how the AI customizes resumes and cover letters:

- `_generate_paragraphs`
- `_generate_cover_letter`


Change the instructions, guidelines, or output format as needed. Ensure you keep the placeholders:
 - For _generate_paragraphs:
  - company_name, job_description, selected_paragraph_ids, resume_data['full_text']
    - If editing single paragraph placeholder, use resume_data['paragraphs']
 - For _generate_cover_letter:
    - company_name
    - resume_data['full_text']
    - job_description
Outputs need not be changed.
